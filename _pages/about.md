  My name is Lei Li, and I am a Researcher at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/en) and the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), associated with the [Pioneer Centre for AI](https://www.aicentre.dk/). It's a great honour to work with Christian Igel, Stefan Oehmcke, Serge Belongie, Jenq-Neng Hwang, and Fabian Gieseke with focusing on multimodal learning and machine learning. I was also a visiting scholar at the Standford University and University of Waterloo. I was a Chief Scientist and Managing Director at the AIthinktank, Senior Researcher at the [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/en), ByteDance, and Intel Lab.
