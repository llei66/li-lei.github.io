Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am working as an algorithm researcher at [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/cn) and a post doc at [THU](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). My current research interests includes lightweight network design, multimodal large language models, diffusion models.

<!-- I am pursuing a PhD at [the Laboratory of Imaging Detection and Intelligent Perecption (IDIP Lab)](http://idiplab.uestc.cn/) of [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), supresived by [Prof. Zhenming Peng](https://www.sice.uestc.edu.cn/info/1302/5086.htm) -->

<!-- My PhD research is dedicated to developing trustworthy infrared small target detection methods and also extended to sparse representation, optimization, deep learning and deep unfolding networks. In collaboration with my colleagues, my research interests also include segmentation and image compressive sensing. -->

Previously, I received my PhD degree from [UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) (2023), supresived by [Prof. Zhenming Peng](https://www.sice.uestc.edu.cn/info/1302/5086.htm), and worked at [the Laboratory of Imaging Detection and Intelligent Perecption (IDIP Lab)](http://idiplab.uestc.cn/). My PhD research is dedicated to developing trustworthy infrared small target detection methods and also extended to sparse representation, optimization, deep learning and deep unfolding networks.

Over the past few years, I had the pleasure of being funded by [China Scholarship Council (CSC)](https://www.csc.edu.cn/) and working at the [Image Section](https://di.ku.dk/english/research/imagesection/) of [Department of Computer Science](https://di.ku.dk/english/), [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/) as a visiting PhD, supervised by [Prof. Jon Sporring](https://sporring.github.io/).
